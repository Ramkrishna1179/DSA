// 1.)CI stands for Continuous Integration, and CD stands for Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery).
//  CI/CD is a set of practices that helps us to automate the process of testing and deploying of our application. It ensures that our app is consistently built, tested, and deployed,reducing the chances of bugs and making the deployment process faster and more reliable.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 2.) Bob: Can you explain the concept of “staging” and “production” environments?

// Tom: Staging and production environments are crucial in CI/CD. Staging is a replica of our production environment where we test changes before deploying to production. It helps catch issues early. The production environment is where our live app resides and is accessible to users.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 3.) Shallow Copy And Deep Copy

// Creates a new object or array that references the same properties of the original object or array.
// Changes made to the copied object's properties will also affect the original object's properties, since they point to the same memory locations.

// const original = { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } };
// const shallowCopy = { ...original };

// console.log(original);   // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } }
// console.log(shallowCopy); // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } }

// shallowCopy.department.team = 'Marketing';

// console.log(original);   // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Marketing' } } (Modified!)
// console.log(shallowCopy); // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Marketing' } }

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Deep Copy

// Creates a completely new object or array with entirely independent copies of all properties, including any nested objects or arrays.
// Changes made to the copied object's properties will not affect the original object's properties.

// const original = { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } };
// const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

// console.log(original);   // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } }
// console.log(deepCopy);  // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } }

// deepCopy.department.team = 'Marketing';

// console.log(original);   // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Engineering' } } (Unchanged)
// console.log(deepCopy);  // { name: 'Alice', department: { team: 'Marketing' } }

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 4.) HOC
// In React, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a pattern for reusing component logic. It is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with extended functionality or behavior.

// 5.) Cors in React
// CORS is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the page. This prevents malicious scripts from stealing data from other websites.


// 6.) Rest Spread
//  The key difference is that the rest operator is used to collect elements into an array or object, while the spread operator is used to spread or expand elements from an array or object.

// Rest 

//  function sum(...numbers) {
//     console.log("🚀 ~ sum ~ numbers:", typeof (numbers),numbers)
    
//   return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
// }
// console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15


// .7) Difference between promise.all() and promise.race()

// Promise is a construct that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

// async/await is a syntactical sugar on top of Promises. The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

// In summary, Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations using a specific syntax and methods, while async/await is a syntax sugar on top of Promises that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like style. async/await is often considered more readable and easier to reason about, especially for complex asynchronous code, but it is built upon and ultimately uses Promises under the hood.

// In summary, Promise.all() waits for all promises to resolve or for any one promise to reject, while Promise.race() resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the input iterable resolves or rejects. Promise.all() is useful when you need to wait for multiple asynchronous operations to complete before proceeding, while Promise.race() is useful when you want to get the first resolved or rejected value from a set of asynchronous operations.

//Promise.all() example 


// const api = useMemo(
//     () =>
//       axios.create({
//         baseURL: Base_Url,
//         headers: {
//           "Content-Type": "application/json",
//           Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
//         },
//       }),
//     [token]
//   );
//   const [workOrdersResponse, cellsResponse, partResponse] =
//   await Promise.all([
//       api.get(`/orderManage/getallworkorders`),
//       api.get(`/orderManage/getallcells`),
//       api.get(`/orderManage/getallparts`),
//   ]);
//   console.log("🚀 ~ workOrdersResponse:", cellsResponse, partResponse,workOrdersResponse)



// 8.) Example of the normal promise function 

// const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
//     // Asynchronous operation
//     setTimeout(() => {
//       const randomValue = Math.random();
//       if (randomValue > 0.5) {
//         resolve('Success!');
//       } else {
//         reject('Failure!');
//       }
//     }, 2000);
//   });
  
//   myPromise
//     .then(result => console.log(result))
//     .catch(error => console.log(error));


// .8) Prototype in javascript 

// In JavaScript, every object has a special internal property called [[Prototype]] (which is internal and can't be accessed directly). This [[Prototype]] is a reference to another object, which is called the prototype of the first object. The prototype object has its own [[Prototype]], which forms a prototype chain that ends with null.
// The prototype is used for two main purposes:

// Property Inheritance: When you try to access a property of an object, if the property is not found in the object itself, the JavaScript engine looks for the property in the object's prototype. If the property is not found there, it continues the search in the next prototype in the chain, until the end of the chain is reached.
// Method Delegation: When you invoke a method on an object, if the method is not defined on the object itself, the JavaScript engine looks for the method in the object's prototype and executes it if found.

// Here's an example to illustrate the concept:
// javascriptCopy code// Creating a constructor function
// function Person(name) {
//   this.name = name;
// }

// // Adding a method to the prototype of Person
// Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
//   console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
// }

// // Creating an instance of Person
// const person1 = new Person('Alice');

// // Invoking the sayHello method (inherited from the prototype)
// person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
// In the above example:

// We create a constructor function Person.
// We add a sayHello method to the prototype of Person. This means that all instances of Person will inherit this method.
// We create an instance person1 using the new operator.
// When we invoke person1.sayHello(), the method is not defined directly on person1, so the JavaScript engine looks for it in the prototype of person1, which is Person.prototype.

// Understanding prototypes is essential for working with objects and creating inheritance in JavaScript. It's a powerful concept that allows you to create hierarchies of objects and share properties and methods among them.
// One important note is that modern JavaScript also includes classes, which provide a more structured and class-based syntax for creating objects and implementing inheritance. However, under the hood, classes in JavaScript still use prototypes and the prototype chain.





// .9) Redux  // Main Redux Components:

// Store: A central object that holds the application's entire state.
// Reducers: Pure functions that define how to update the state based on dispatched actions.
// Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe the event that happened and (optionally) carry data.
// Middleware: Optional functions that intercept dispatched actions and can perform side effects like data fetching.


// .10) StateFull and StateLess components.
// Stateful Components (Remember Their State):

// Imagine a component like a light switch. It can be on (state = true) or off (state = false).
// Stateful components remember their own state, which can change over time.
// We can use them when our component needs to track data that affects its appearance or behavior (e.g., forms, counters).

// Stateless Components (No Memory, Just Function):

// Think of a stateless component like a simple calculator button. It just displays a number (props) and doesn't remember anything.
// Stateless components rely on data (props) received from parent components and don't manage their own state.
//We can use them for simpler UI elements that just display information (e.g., product cards, headings).

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Controlled Components
// Controlled components are those where the form data is handled by the state within the component. These components rely on React's state to manage their form inputs.

// Key Characteristics:

// Form data is stored in the component’s state.
// The state is updated via event handlers.
// Input elements use value prop, which is tied to the state.
// React has full control over the form data.
// Example:

// jsx
// Copy code
// import React, { useState } from 'react';

// const ControlledForm = () => {
//   const [name, setName] = useState('');

//   const handleChange = (event) => {
//     setName(event.target.value);
//   };

//   const handleSubmit = (event) => {
//     event.preventDefault();
//     alert(`Submitted name: ${name}`);
//   };

//   return (
//     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
//       <label>
//         Name:
//         <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
//       </label>
//       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
//     </form>
//   );
// };

// export default ControlledForm;


// Uncontrolled Components

// Uncontrolled components are those where the form data is handled by the DOM itself. These components use refs to access the form data directly from the DOM elements.

// Key Characteristics:

// Form data is stored in the DOM, not in the component’s state.
// React does not manage the state of form inputs.
// Input elements do not use value prop but rely on defaultValue.
// Refs are used to access form data when needed.
// Example:

// jsx
// Copy code
// import React, { useRef } from 'react';

// const UncontrolledForm = () => {
//   const nameRef = useRef();

//   const handleSubmit = (event) => {
//     event.preventDefault();
//     alert(`Submitted name: ${nameRef.current.value}`);
//   };

//   return (
//     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
//       <label>
//         Name:
//         <input type="text" defaultValue="" ref={nameRef} />
//       </label>
//       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
//     </form>
//   );
// };

// export default UncontrolledForm;



// .11) Ways to optimize the performance of the React or Nextjs application.

// a. Component Optimization:

// Use Function Components: Function components are generally lighter-weight than class-based components due to their simpler structure. This can lead to faster rendering times.

// b.) Prop Drilling vs. Context API/Redux: 
// Avoid excessive prop drilling by passing data down through many levels of components. Consider using the Context API or Redux for global state management, especially for complex applications.

// c.) Rendering Optimization:

// Conditional Rendering: Use conditional logic (e.g., if statements or ternary operators) to only render elements based on certain conditions, reducing the amount of DOM that needs to be updated.

// d.)Fragment Optimization: 
// Wrap multiple elements in a React Fragment (<> ... </>) instead of unnecessary divs to avoid extra DOM nodes.


// e.)Virtualization for Large Lists:
//  For long lists of data, use libraries like react-virtualized or react-window to efficiently render only the visible items, improving scrolling performance.


// 5. Third-Party Libraries:

// Choose Libraries Wisely:
//  Evaluate the performance impact of third-party libraries which we  integrate into our application. Consider alternatives with smaller bundle sizes or lazy loading them when needed.


// Update Libraries: 
// Keep your libraries updated to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes provided by the maintainers.

// Memoization
// Memoization is a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can improve performance by avoiding redundant calculations.

// Virtualization
// Virtualization is a technique used to render only the visible portions of a large list or grid, improving performance by reducing the number of DOM nodes rendered.
// Example: Using the react-virtualized library for virtualized rendering of lists:

// Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
// Server-side rendering can improve the initial load time by rendering the initial markup on the server and sending it to the client, reducing the amount of work the client needs to do.

// Example: Using Next.js's built-in server-side rendering:


// Optimizing Assets
// Optimizing assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets can significantly improve load times. Techniques include image optimization, font subsetting, and CSS minification.

// Example: Using Next.js's built-in image optimization:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



// 12.)What are the major features of React?

// Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is used for efficient updates and rendering of UI components.
// JSX: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create and work with React components.
// Components: React follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are built as reusable components.
// One-way Data Binding: React implements one-way data binding, which makes the flow of data more predictable and easier to debug.
// React Native: React Native allows developers to build native mobile apps using React components and concepts.


// 13.) What is the purpose of render() in React?
// The render() method in React is responsible for describing the UI of a React component. It returns a single React element (or null if there is nothing to render). The render() method is called whenever the state or props of a component change, and it should be a pure function, meaning it should not modify the component's state or cause side effects.


// 14 .) What is the purpose of keys in React?
// In React, keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a list or array. Keys help React to keep track of which elements have been added, removed, or re-ordered during updates. When rendering a list of components, it's important to assign a unique key to each component to help React for optimizing the rendering process and minimize unnecessary re-renders.


// 15 .) ESLINT
// ESLint is a popular linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript that helps developers identify and fix problems in their code. It enforces coding standards and best practices by analyzing your code for potential errors and code style issues. In the context of a Next.js application, ESLint can be used to maintain code quality and consistency throughout your project.
//---------------------------


// 13.) Why we should use React over js?

// Component-based architecture:
// React's component model allows developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces. Each component manages its own state and props, making it easier to maintain and scale applications. This modularity improves code organization, reusability, and testing. For example, you can create a Button component and reuse it throughout your application with different props for different use cases.

// Virtual DOM:
// React uses a virtual representation of the DOM in memory. When state changes occur, React first updates this virtual DOM, computes the differences (diffing), and then efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM. This approach significantly reduces the number of expensive DOM operations, leading to better performance, especially in complex, dynamic UIs.

// Declarative syntax:
// React allows developers to describe what they want the UI to look like, rather than imperatively defining each step to achieve that result. This declarative approach makes the code more predictable and easier to debug. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, you describe the desired end state, and React handles the updates.

// Imperative Programming: Javascript

// Describes step-by-step how to achieve a result
// Focuses on the exact steps the program should take
// Directly manipulates the state


// Declarative Programming: React

// Describes what you want to achieve
// Focuses on the end result, not the step-by-step process
// Abstracts away the complex state manipulations

 
// Imperative (vanilla JavaScript):
// javascriptCopylet isOn = false;
// const button = document.getElementById('toggleButton');
// const status = document.getElementById('status');

// button.addEventListener('click', () => {
//   if (isOn) {
//     isOn = false;
//     button.textContent = 'Turn On';
//     status.textContent = 'Off';
//   } else {
//     isOn = true;
//     button.textContent = 'Turn Off';
//     status.textContent = 'On';
//   }
// });

// Declarative (React):
// jsxCopyfunction ToggleButton() {
//   const [isOn, setIsOn] = React.useState(false);

//   return (
//     <div>
//       <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>
//         Turn {isOn ? 'Off' : 'On'}
//       </button>
//       <p>Status: {isOn ? 'On' : 'Off'}</p>
//     </div>
//   );
// }


// Advantages of React's Declarative Approach:

// Simplicity: The code focuses on describing the UI for each state, making it easier to understand at a glance.

// Predictability: By declaring how the UI should look for each state, it's easier to predict the application's behavior.

// Easier Debugging: When issues arise, you can focus on the logic of your state transitions rather than tracking DOM manipulations.

// Separation of Concerns: The rendering logic is separated from the state management, leading to cleaner, more modular code.

// Reusability: Declarative components are often more reusable as they're not tightly coupled to specific DOM manipulations.



//-------------

// Efficient updates:
// React's reconciliation algorithm efficiently determines what parts of the UI need to change when data changes. This, combined with the virtual DOM, allows React to minimize DOM manipulations and perform batched updates, resulting in smooth and responsive user interfaces, even for complex applications.

// JSX:
// JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code, making the relationship between code and UI more intuitive. JSX also helps catch errors early through compile-time checks.

// Unidirectional data flow:
// React enforces a unidirectional (one-way) data flow. Data in React flows down the component tree from parent to child components. This makes it easier to track where and how data changes in your application, reducing bugs and making the application more predictable and easier to debug.

// Server-side rendering:
// React can render on the server using Node.js. This allows for faster initial page loads, improves SEO (as search engines can crawl the fully rendered page), and enhances the experience for users with slower internet connections or less powerful devices.

// React Native:
// React principles can be applied to mobile app development through React Native. This allows developers to use their React skills to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android. It significantly reduces the learning curve for web developers transitioning to mobile development and allows for code sharing between web and mobile platforms.

// Mempization in javascript
